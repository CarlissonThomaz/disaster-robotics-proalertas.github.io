### Goals

 - Goal 1: an integrated simulation environment to test and evaluate different strategies under diferent disaster scenarios.
 - Goal 2: test the integrated environment in real life application with heterogeneous agents.

### Milestones

 - Milestone 1: Integrate Digital Elevation Map of Porto Alegre into the simulator; status (100%)
 - Milestone 2: Model different types of agents (UAVs, USVs, response team) into the simulator; status (80%)
 - Milestone 3: Integrate multi-agent framework into the simulation model; status (20%)
 - Milestone 4: Integrate alert framework into the simulation model; status (0%)
 - Milestone 5: Test flow alert --> planning --> agent action into the simulation model; status (10%)
 - Milestone 6: Model different disaster scenarios; status (0%)
 - Milestone 7: Field tests with different agents in using real robots under realistic scenarios; status (0%)
