### Goals

 - Goal 1: deliver a small boat with safe autonomous navigation;
 - Goal 2: deliver a boat control system integrated to planning frameworks;
 - Goal 3: deliver a system to control multiple boats;

### Milestones

 - Milestone 1: integrate more sensors to the Lutra boat to enable autonomous behaviors; status (%)
 - Milestone 2: improve localization for safe autonomous navigation nearby manmade structures (docks) and shores; status (%)
 - Milestone 3: detect obstacles (both underwater and over the water) for safe autonomous navigation nearby manmade structures and shores; status (%)
 - Milestone 4: integrate different navigation strategies (fast, safe, coverage navigation) under real life disturbances (drag, wind, waves) for safe autonomous navigation nearby manmade structures and shores; status (%)
 - Milestone 5: integrate the boat middlware to the AI and planning frameworks; status (%)
 - Milestone 6: control simultaneously multiple boats in formations; status (%)
 - Milestone 7: field test controling simultaneously multiple boats; status (%)
