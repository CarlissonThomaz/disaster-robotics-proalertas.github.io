	booktitle = {Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference},

	keywords = {Planning; Visualization; Metaphor},
	abstract = {While domain descriptions are often shared and manipulated through diagrams, most complex domains are still described using text-based languages. Code becomes an intermediary between the real-world and an abstract idea, and the programmer is merely a converter of diagrams into code. For automated planning this is no different. The state transition function is described in terms of a textual representation of actions and, although simple actions require little effort to define by the user, the learning process is often slow. New users have no metaphor to help them to visualize the domain description that they are working on and little information about why a planner fails due to formalization errors. In this paper, we propose a visual abstraction for both the planning domain actions and the planning process itself, to facilitate the design of classical planning domains. Using this abstraction, we expect to improve the learning curve for defining and subsequently diagnosing problems with new planning domains.},

	abstract = {Classical planning is a computationally expensive task, especially when tackling real world problems. 
To overcome such limitations, most realistic applications of planning rely on domain knowledge configured by a domain expert, such as the hierarchy of tasks and methods used by Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning. 
Thus, the efficiency of HTN approaches relies heavily on human-driven domain design.
In this paper, we aim to address this limitation by developing an approach to generate useful methods based on classical domains.
Our work does not require annotations in the classical planning operators or training examples, and instead, relies solely on operator descriptions to identify task patterns and the sub-problems related to each pattern.
We propose the use of methods that solve common sub-problems to obtain HTN methods automatically.}
