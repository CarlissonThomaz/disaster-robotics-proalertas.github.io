ABSTRACT = {The use of robotics in disaster scenarios has become a reality. However, an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) needs a robust navigation strategy to face unpredictable environmental forces such as waves, wind, and water current. A starting step toward this goal is to have a programming environment with realistic USV models where designers can assess their control strategies under different degrees of environmental disturbances. This paper presents a simulation environment integrated with robotic middleware which models the forces that act on a USV in a disaster scenario. Results show that these environmental forces affect the USV&rsquo;s trajectories negatively, indicating the need for more research on USV control strategies considering harsh environmental conditions. Evaluation scenarios were presented to highlight specific features of the simulator, including a bridge inspection scenario with fast water current and winds.},

ABSTRACT = {Disaster robotics has become a research area in its own right, with several reported cases of successful robot deployment in actual disaster scenarios. Most of these disaster deployments use aerial, ground, or underwater robotic platforms. However, the research involving autonomous boats or Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) for Disaster Management (DM) is currently spread across several publications, with varying degrees of depth, and focusing on more than one unmanned vehicle&mdash;usually under the umbrella of Unmanned Marine Vessels (UMV). Therefore, the current importance of USVs for the DM process in its different phases is not clear. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey about the applications and roles of USVs for DM, as far as we know. This work demonstrates that there are few current deployments in disaster scenarios, with most of the research in the area focusing on the technological aspects of USV hardware and software, such as Guidance Navigation and Control, and not focusing on their actual importance for DM. Finally, to guide future research, this paper also summarizes our own contributions, the lessons learned, guidelines, and research gaps.},

	abstract = {While domain descriptions are often shared and manipulated through diagrams, most complex domains are still described using text-based languages. Code becomes an intermediary between the real-world and an abstract idea, and the programmer is merely a converter of diagrams into code. For automated planning this is no different. The state transition function is described in terms of a textual representation of actions and, although simple actions require little effort to define by the user, the learning process is often slow. New users have no metaphor to help them to visualize the domain description that they are working on and little information about why a planner fails due to formalization errors. In this paper, we propose a visual abstraction for both the planning domain actions and the planning process itself, to facilitate the design of classical planning domains. Using this abstraction, we expect to improve the learning curve for defining and subsequently diagnosing problems with new planning domains.},

	abstract = {Classical planning is a computationally expensive task, especially when tackling real world problems. 
To overcome such limitations, most realistic applications of planning rely on domain knowledge configured by a domain expert, such as the hierarchy of tasks and methods used by Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning. 
Thus, the efficiency of HTN approaches relies heavily on human-driven domain design.
In this paper, we aim to address this limitation by developing an approach to generate useful methods based on classical domains.
Our work does not require annotations in the classical planning operators or training examples, and instead, relies solely on operator descriptions to identify task patterns and the sub-problems related to each pattern.
We propose the use of methods that solve common sub-problems to obtain HTN methods automatically.}

New users often find it challenging to understand the plan generation process, while experienced users often find it difficult to track semantic errors and efficiency issues.
To simplify this process, in this paper, we develop a cloud-based planning tool with code editing and state-space visualization capabilities.
The code editor focuses on visualizing the domain, problem, and resulting sample plan, helping the user to see how such descriptions are connected without changing context.
The visualization tool explores two alternative visualizations aimed at illustrating the operation of the planning process and how the domain dynamics evolve during plan execution.}

ABSTRACT = {Natural landmarks are the main features in the next step of the research in localization of mobile robot platforms. The identification and recognition of these landmarks are crucial to better localize a robot. To help solving this problem, this work proposes an approach for the identification and recognition of natural marks included in the environment using images from RGB-D (Red, Green, Blue, Depth) sensors. In the identification step, a structural analysis of the natural landmarks that are present in the environment is performed. The extraction of edge points of these landmarks is done using the 3D point cloud obtained from the RGB-D sensor. These edge points are smoothed through the     S  l 0      algorithm, which minimizes the standard deviation of the normals at each point. Then, the second step of the proposed algorithm begins, which is the proper recognition of the natural landmarks. This recognition step is done as a real-time algorithm that extracts the points referring to the filtered edges and determines to which structure they belong to in the current scenario: stairs or doors. Finally, the geometrical characteristics that are intrinsic to the doors and stairs are identified. The approach proposed here has been validated with real robot experiments. The performed tests verify the efficacy of our proposed approach.},
