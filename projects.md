The goal of this project is to build an integrated system to control a team of heterogeneous robots (aerial, boats, land) and alert systems.
The figure below shows an overview of the system using two agents (UAV and USV) and an intelligent sensor.

In general, the system can be viewed as a large scale supervisory system (about the size of a typical Brazilian capital) that uses mobile agents and statics sensors. 
By mobile agents we understand as boats, cars, and unmanned aircrafts with a semi-autonomous behavior. 
Static sensors include pluviometers, water volume meters, etc. 
For the sake of simplicity, initially we consider only sensors that can be accessed by the internet.

A macro view of the different work fronts of the project can be seen in the figure below, where the supervisory system consists of layers of software and hardware, modularizing the system. 
On the top, there is the view of the system's supervisors. 
Supervisors have a limited number of agents with the ability to perform actions of preventing or mitigating a disaster.
